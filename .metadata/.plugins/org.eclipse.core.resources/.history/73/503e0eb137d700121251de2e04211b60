	 * 
	 * Okay now let us look at this line -> public static void main(){}
	 * public means that anyone can access it. It's like an access mode. Others are private, protected which we will discuss later.    
	 * static means that you can run this method without creating an instance of Main.
	 * void means that this method doesn't return any value. Or else we must use the `return "something";` if in case it is supposed to return anything. 
	 * main is the name of the method. 
	 * 
	 * Now let us look at the statement inside the eclosed brackers -> `String[] args`
	 * We need to pass some arguements to a method we define. In this case it's an array of strings.

		 * System is a pre-defined class that Java provides us and it holds some useful methods and variables. You should refer to java docs to know more.
		 * out is a static variable in within System class that basically holds the output.
		 * 
		 * Now remember two things here. 
		 * if you use System.out.println(), the cursor skips the line and moves to next line after displaying required result.
		 * if you use System.out.print(), the cursor remain on the same line after displaying the result.
