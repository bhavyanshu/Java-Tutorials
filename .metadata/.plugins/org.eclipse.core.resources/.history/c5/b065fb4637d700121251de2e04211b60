	 * public means that anyone can access it. It's like an access mode. Others are private, protected which we will discuss later.    
	 * static means that you can run this method without creating an instance of Main.
	 * void means that this method doesn't return any value. Or else we must use the `return "something";` if in case it is supposed to return anything. 
	 * main is the name of the method.

		 * if you use System.out.println(), the cursor skips the line and moves to next line after displaying required result.
		 * if you use System.out.print(), the cursor remain on the same line after displaying the result.
